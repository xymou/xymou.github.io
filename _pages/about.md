About me
------
Greetings! I am Xinyi Mou.ü§° I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at Fudan University, advised by Prof. [Zhongyu Wei](http://www.fudan-disc.com/people/zywei). I am also a member of the [Data Intelligence and Social Computing Lab](http://fudan-disc.com/) (Fudan DISC). 


Research Interests
------
My work spans Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science. I'm particularly excited about these research thrusts:
- ü§ñSimulate Social Media Using LLMs as Agents.
- üíªExplore and Improve Capabilities of LLMs to Solve Computational Social Science Tasks.
- üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏èKey Figure Modeling and Discourse Analysis.
