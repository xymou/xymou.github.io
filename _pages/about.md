About me
------
Greetings! I am Xinyi Mou.ü§° I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at Fudan University, where I'm advised by Prof. [Zhongyu Wei](http://www.fudan-disc.com/people/zywei). I am also a member of the [Data Intelligence and Social Computing Lab](http://fudan-disc.com/) (Fudan DISC). During my PhD, I've spent a precious time with the THUNLP Lab at Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. [Zhiyuan Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/), Prof. [Huimin Chen](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~chm/) and Dr. [Chen Qian](https://qianc62.github.io/).


Research Interests
------
My work spans Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science. I'm particularly excited about these research thrusts:
- ü§ñSocial Simulation empowered by Large Language Model.
- üíªExplore and Improve the Capabilities of LLMs to Solve Computational Social Science Tasks.
- üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏èKey Figure Modeling and Discourse Analysis.
