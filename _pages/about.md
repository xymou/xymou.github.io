About me
------
Hello, my name is Xinyi Mou.ü§° I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at Fudan University, advised by Prof. [Zhongyu Wei](http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zywei/). I am also a member of the [Data Intelligence and Social Computing Lab](http://fudan-disc.com/) (Fudan DISC). 



Research Interests
------
My research perspectives of interest include natural language processing and computational social science, with special emphasis on:
- üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏èpolitical actor modeling: to explore intentions and beliefs behind the languages and behaviors of politicians and other persons.
- üìïknowledge-driven computational sociology: to leverage external knowledge to deal with some tricky situations in social media and our society.
- üîçbias detection: to detect and change the bias reflected in languages.
